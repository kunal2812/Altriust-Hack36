## Introduction:
  Often there are cases where we hear college students suffering from depression and taking harsh actions due to several issues such as academic pressure, peer pressure etc.</br>
  Not a major issue considering the the other issues India is facing but yes it is a serious issue</br>
  Our project attempts to keep a check on the happiness level of all the hostellers through the CCTV footage</br>
  CCTV might be used at the entrance</br>
  Altruist uses 2 models, one of which is to recognise the person in the frame and the other to check and measure the happiness level</br>
  Altruist keeps track of all hostellers over a period of time and gives warning and can text warden, parents or friend to talk more often to the subject, if it falls below a certain threshold
